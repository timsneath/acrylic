# Acrylic

An experimental attempt at porting [flutter_acrylic](https://github.com/alexmercerind/flutter_acrylic)
to Dart, using FFI instead of the traditional platform channel approach. This draws heavily from the
work of Hitesh Kumar Saini, and the credit belongs to him. Check out his other work:
